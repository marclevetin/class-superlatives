# Class Superlatives
A website to capture the "best of" for UNH Coding Bootcamp's "September 2017-March 2018" class, built in the MERN stack, styled with Bootstrap 3, and hosted on Heroku.  Purposefully built for possible abuse and probable fun.

Note to students: This project is also a good sample of how to organize your React code.
